Dotclear plugin to search, find and link any word or expression on Wikipedia

When editing a post, a page, or a related page, select some word or expression and click on dcWikipedia icon. This opens up a popup window where you can choose a wikipedia page, which would be linked to the selected word or expression.

This plugin was first developped by Tomtmo33, see https://lab.dotclear.org/wiki/plugin/dcWikipedia

Since it was not maintained any more, I've fixed the plugin so that it works now with Dotclear 2.19. Morever, version 0.3.0 adds support for _dcCKEditor_ in addition to _dcLegacyEditor_.

Version 0.3.1 add support for Dotclear 2.24.

`hreflang` attribute is added on Wikipedia link by default. To unactivate this feature, change the `dcwp_add_lang_flag` option in `about:config`.
